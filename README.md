What is LRCO - NFT?

LRCO - NFT offers the opportunity to its subscribers to store, demonstrate, trade directly or through auctions their NFTs.
LRCO - NFT gives also to the users the ability to discover other users’ NFTs in order to invest on them or just to admire other peoples’ fantasy and creativity!
For those who may not be familiar enough with the term NFT, we are excited to explain: NFTs are a new type of digital goods which are unique, tradeable, scarce and can be used across multiple applications. NFT in other words means a non-fungible token or similar digital item implemented on a blockchain (such as the Ethereum blockchain), which uses smart contracts to link to or otherwise be associated with certain content or data.
NFTs are ideal for investment, joy or as a gift to friends, family members or lovers. Unlike physical goods, they can be sent or stored without limitations to any place of the world with privacy.
Our vision is to expand all opportunities that NFTs are offering in any level: social, economic, creative, phantasy.
LRCO-NFT is also proud to present the Luxury Royal Coin (LRCO) crypto token, with which you able to make transactions in the NFT platform.
